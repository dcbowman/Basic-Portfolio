		<h2> About Me </h2>

	 <img src="assets/images/IMG_7771.jpg" alt="pic" id="bio-img" style="height:200px; width:200px">
		
		<p> I'm an Ohio native and a 2004 graduate of Kent State University. A strong dislike for grey skies, snow and all things cold inspired the move to sunny Orlando in 2011. After 12 years of success as a Store Manager for Walgreens I realized I still had about 25 working years left until retirement. I immediately felt a strong drive to run far away from retail. I'm excited for this new beginning.</p>
		<p>A few things I think are awesome: wine, Bon Jovi, late 90's early 2000's rap, food festivals, speakeasies, live music, Law and Order marathons, Dobby from Harry Potter and the beach. My coolest friend is my dog Jovi. I have terrible handwriting and kill every plant that I come into contact with. I have no rhythm but I love dance workout videos. I just started to train for my first half marathon even though every time I run all I think about is how much I hate running. As a bonus addition to all of these amazing qualities, I also have a dodgy British accent that once I start using I have trouble stopping. Cheerio!!!</p>
